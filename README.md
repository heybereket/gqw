# gqw
üè∑Ô∏è Type-safe Github API Wrapper

## Getting Started
```bash
# Yarn
yarn install gqw

# NPM
npm install gqw
```
## Why?
The Github REST API doesn't provide deeper query fetching (for ex. finding github users by email), so I thought this may be helpful. It's based off of Octokit and is user friendly - I'm working on adding more queries as well. <br/> <br/> Feel free to open a PR and add your own too :)
